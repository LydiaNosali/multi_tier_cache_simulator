NDN short for Named Data Networking is the only project that succeded out of the five projects funded by the U.S.
National Science Foundation under its Future Internet Architecture Program in 2010
NDN is a specific architecture design that came as an improved version of Content Centric Network CCN which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006
NDN investigates the evolution from todays host-centric network architecture IP to a data-centric network architecture NDN
When an Interest packet arrives an NDN router first checks the Content Store for matching data
if it exists in the router the Data packet is returned on the interface from which the Interest came
Otherwise the router looks up the name in its PIT and if a matching entry exists it simply records the incoming interface of this Interest in the PIT entry
In the absence of a matching PIT entry the router will forward the Interest toward the data producers based on information in the FIB
When a router receives Interests for the same name from multiple downstream nodes it forwards only the first one upstream toward the data producer
